This is the repository that contains the core concepts in python with both theoretical explanation and practical(code examples).
It is a good place to relearn the core concepts that actually make you a developer.
This is my personal work which I have developed carefully but please use it for educational purposes only.
When you go through them always make sure to reasearch the concepts for better understaning and only use this as a knowledge plug-in not as the sole resource.
