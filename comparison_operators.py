"""
In Python, comparison operators are used to compare the values of two variables and return a Boolean value (True or False) based on the result of the comparison. The following are the comparison operators in Python:

== (equal to)
!= (not equal to)
> (greater than)

< (less than)
>= (greater than or equal to)

<= (less than or equal to)
These operators are commonly used in control flow statements, such as if/else statements, to make decisions based on the values of variables.
