"""
File I/O in Python refers to the process of reading and writing data to and from files on your computer. You can use Python's built-in functions and methods to perform file I/O operations.
"""
#For example, let's say you have a file called "my_file.txt" on your computer that you want to read. You can use the following code in Python to open the file, read its contents, and print them to the screen:
#with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
#     contents = file.read()
#     print(contents)
#In this code, the open() function is used to open the file, and its first argument is the name of the file you want to open. The second argument, "r", indicates that you want to open the file in read mode.

"""
The with statement is used to automatically close the file after the operation is complete. Inside the with statement, the read() method is used to read the contents of the file, and the resulting string is stored in the contents variable. Finally, the print() function is used to display the contents of the file on the screen.

If you want to write to a file instead of reading from it, you can use the following code:
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
In this code, the second argument to open() is "w", which indicates that you want to open the file in write mode. The with statement is used to automatically close the file after the write operation is complete. The write() method is used to write the string "Hello, world!" to the file.
"""
#It's important to note that when you open a file in write mode, any existing contents of the file will be overwritten. If you want to add to the file instead of overwriting it, you can open the file in append mode by using "a" as the second argument to open(), like this:
# with open("my_file.txt", "a") as file:
#     file.write("This is some more text.")
# In this code, the second argument to open() is "a", which indicates that you want to open the file in append mode. The with statement and write() method work the same way as in the previous example, but the new string is added to the end of the existing contents of the file, rather than overwriting them.

# File I/O in Python can be a powerful tool for working with data on your computer, but it's important to be careful when reading and writing files to avoid accidentally deleting or corrupting important data.
